# New-Responsive-Web-Design---FreeCode
<b>Lessons and Projects learned on the course <u>(New) Responsive Web Design</u> from FreeCodeCamp.</b>

This course is divided in sections, for my web page I divided them in 5 parts, each one opening most exercises on a popup.
The only lessons that open in a new tab are the projects (the original version and my version).

The course is free and have multiple languages for you to study. I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend to study in English.

After each lesson I downloaded the code and used <b>Replit</b> for making this website.

For the course you will use the website itself for programming, so you don't have to install anything.
